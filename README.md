# automato-etc

This is a repo mainly for automato related code that runs on non-automato hardware
such as laptops, raspberry pis, web servers, and so forth.  There are also automato
sketches here for use with these 'client side' libraries and apps.

See also the automato [board package](https://github.com/InterstitialTech/automato-arduino) and
[arduino library](https://github.com/InterstitialTech/automato-library).
